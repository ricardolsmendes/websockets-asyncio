# websockets-asyncio

Companion repository for **WebSockets and AsyncIO: Beyond 5-line Samples**, an article that brings
related technology, design tips, programming libraries, and quality assurance matters together.

The article is split into two parts:

1. in the [first](https://medium.com/better-programming/websockets-and-asyncio-beyond-5-line-samples-part-1-ddf8699a18ce),
   I sum up some relevant WebSocket facets and how they fit Python through the [`websockets`](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets)
   library;
1. in the [second](https://medium.com/better-programming/a-deeper-look-at-async-and-concurrent-programming-in-python-9f2a84adbdd2),
   I shift attention to asynchronous and concurrent programming, exploring the [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/asyncio.html)
   built-in library more deeply.

Technical discussions happen on top of a fictitious use case that guides me to cover the
above-mentioned topics.
